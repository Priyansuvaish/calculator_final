# Scientific Calculator with DevOps Integration

This project demonstrates a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for a Scientific Calculator application, showcasing best practices in software development, testing, containerization, and deployment automation.

## Introduction

The Scientific Calculator application is designed to perform a variety of mathematical operations. This project leverages DevOps methodologies to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid delivery and high reliability.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Advanced mathematical functions including square root, factorial, power, and natural logarithm calculations

## DevOps Pipeline Overview

- **Source Control Management**: Utilizes Git and GitHub for version control and source code management.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated build and deployment with Jenkins.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used for packaging and deploying the application in a consistent environment.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible scripts for automating server configurations.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Setup (not detailed in PDF, but typically involves tools like ELK Stack for insights into application performance and behavior).

## Tools Used

- GitHub for source control
- Maven for building the code
- JUnit for testing
- Jenkins for CI/CD
- Docker for containerization
- Ansible for deployment
